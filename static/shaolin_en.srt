00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:19,400
During the nation's early years, powers compete
to conquer China, each furthering their own military

2
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,040
reach and empire. Warlords big and small side
with foreigners at the expense of the people. Endless

3
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,039
battles turn the land into hell on earth.

4
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:35,648
Dengfeng, Henan.

5
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:45,918
Amitabha.

6
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:14,705
Amitabha.

7
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,301
Brother, we have a live one here.

8
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:02,430
Wake up!

9
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:03,761
Wake up!

10
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:12,329
Quickly! Don't let them escape!

11
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:21,968
After them!

12
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:39,395
Kill! Leave not one!

13
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,369
Sir, eat it slowly.

14
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,762
Eat it while it's hot.

15
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:30,773
Thank you.

16
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:33,595
Brother, yet another two hundred arrive.

17
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:35,997
Jingkong, winter will come soon.

18
00:04:36,007 --> 00:04:38,610
Before the blizzards reach the mountain,
we must build more shelters.

19
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,312
We've already run out of wood and straw.

20
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,943
What else do you want me to build with?

21
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:44,886
Then take what we can out of our rooms
and give it to these people.

22
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:48,529
No way, I am deathly afraid of the cold.

23
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:52,763
Look at these mantou, each day
it gets smaller and smaller.

24
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:54,775
So we needn't worry about freezing to death.

25
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:57,307
Even before winter arrives,

26
00:04:57,417 --> 00:05:01,021
You will have already starved to death.

27
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:14,884
After him!

28
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:29,848
Search!

29
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:39,798
Come out!

30
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,505
Out of the way! Bring him out!

31
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:03,379
- Stop!
- Don't move!

32
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,613
- You! Over here!
- Stop! Don't move!

33
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:10,495
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

34
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:21,526
Out of the way!

35
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:22,978
Out of the way!

36
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,854
You can't enter!

37
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:30,865
Stop!

38
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:33,958
You can't enter!

39
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:35,319
Off the horse!

40
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:41,024
Off the horse!

41
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,283
Abbot, save me.

42
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,537
Stinkin' monks!

43
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,909
Commander Hou wants this man's head! Those
who harbour him will share in his crime!

44
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:02,594
I don't care who you are! You will
not disturb these grounds!

45
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:56,435
Come then.

46
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:00,669
Hey! Hey!

47
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,872
Save him and I'll send you to meet the Buddha.

48
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,943
He's lost a lot of blood.

49
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,295
Quickly, get the haemostatic powder.

50
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:08,387
Yes, Abbot.

51
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:12,670
Commander Hou arrives!

52
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:32,989
These people have welcomed you with
a display of their Shaolin kungfu.

53
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:37,594
And you reply with guns? You are without manners.

54
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:39,196
Commander Hou.

55
00:08:58,283 --> 00:08:59,644
Sir, please don't move.

56
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:01,446
Abbot, you also don't move.

57
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,947
He's nearing death.

58
00:09:02,957 --> 00:09:05,119
Help him, send him off.

59
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,801
Amitabha.

60
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:11,205
Buddha sends the fated.

61
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,709
He has arrived, even if it is on his last breath,

62
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,791
I must still help him.

63
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,023
I ask sir to show compassion.

64
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:23,757
No more meaningless deaths.

65
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:27,430
If he doesn't die, I will not sleep easy.

66
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,745
When the heart is removed from dread,
dreams will no longer be troubled.

67
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:35,248
With a benevolent heart, everywhere
you go will be the Pure Land.

68
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,609
The Pure Land?

69
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,264
Abbot, you've stayed at Shaolin temple
for far too long, you're confused.

70
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:45,998
If I don't kill him, the fighting will continue.

71
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:48,270
This will mean more killing.

72
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,703
How will we reach the Pure Land then?

73
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:54,296
Hou Jie.

74
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:57,208
I admit defeat.

75
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,922
Dengfeng City is already yours.

76
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,183
If you spare me...

77
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:08,279
I will give all my wealth and money to you.

78
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,609
This...

79
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,183
Is the gold I buried.

80
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:15,716
Take it.

81
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:19,499
If you don't kill me, I promise...

82
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:21,601
I will never return.

83
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,136
Thank you, Abbot.

84
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:00,948
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

85
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:02,659
Sir!

86
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,261
Sir!

87
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,711
Defend the temple!

88
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:19,575
Jingneng, Jingkong, stand down.

89
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:40,034
A joyous arrival to a sad departure...

90
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,499
The void in our world is once again felt.

91
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:47,541
Would it not have been better
to have not come and gone...

92
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:51,065
To be free from happiness and sadness?

93
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:52,557
Amitabha.

94
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,390
Go.

95
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:10,953
[PLAQUE: The Source of All Martial
Arts] [GRAFFITI: Empty words.]

96
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:03,182
Big brother, we are meeting with
the foreigners tomorrow.

97
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:04,193
What for?

98
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:08,558
With proper funding, we can buy many
machine guns and cannons.

99
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,899
With it, we can take Zhengzhou.

100
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:15,574
More guns is good, but useless if you don't fire them.

101
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:19,818
Tell me, back at Shaolin, why didn't you fire?

102
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,841
Compassion?

103
00:13:24,432 --> 00:13:27,936
Remember this, when you gain the upper hand...

104
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:31,368
And you hesitate a moment too long...

105
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:33,611
The one dead will be you.

106
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:34,792
Next time...

107
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:38,316
The next time I come across someone
standing in Brother's way...

108
00:13:38,326 --> 00:13:40,847
I will definitely kill him.

109
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,011
Then you've learned.

110
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:48,505
Song Hu has already arrived.

111
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,767
That's "Commander Song".

112
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,522
The bastard, we fight without seeing any of his men.

113
00:13:56,532 --> 00:14:02,297
But come time to divide the spoils,
he's here ever so quickly.

114
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,295
Brother Hu, Dengfeng City has been taken.

115
00:14:10,555 --> 00:14:12,177
Huo Long is dead.

116
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,430
For a nobody such as Huo Long...

117
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:17,792
Why such a commotion?

118
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:22,167
I would think you were still seeing the coffin off.

119
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:24,808
We are in rememberance of the
hundreds of brothers lost.

120
00:14:24,818 --> 00:14:25,900
Is that so?

121
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,883
I am in your debt then.

122
00:14:29,323 --> 00:14:32,786
Against Huo Long, I didn't come,
not to take advantage of you...

123
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:35,259
If it weren't for these two bum legs...

124
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,601
My horse and gun alone would have
been enough to sort him out.

125
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,044
Isn't that right, brother?

126
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:46,248
What is a little loss on my part? I do not fret.

127
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:50,673
I know that. You fret because of DengFeng City.

128
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:01,483
Sister-in-law, it's been too long.

129
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:02,494
Big brother.

130
00:15:02,494 --> 00:15:04,926
Shengnan, my darling girl.

131
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,318
Greet your Uncle Song.

132
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:07,629
Hello, Uncle Song.

133
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,080
Hello, Nan-Nan.

134
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,865
Sister, your Nan-nan is growing up to be very polite.

135
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,377
More beautiful with age.

136
00:15:15,387 --> 00:15:19,310
With a daughter like her, be careful
someone doesn't steal her away.

137
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,653
It's decided, this child will be one of the family.

138
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:25,095
My future daughter-in-law.

139
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,197
When was this arranged?

140
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:30,100
It doesn't matter, now is all the same.

141
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,911
What? You disagree?

142
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:36,116
If you disagree then let's fight.

143
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:15,762
Good.

144
00:16:17,034 --> 00:16:18,035
Good gun.

145
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,938
This is a fully automatic weapon.

146
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:23,830
You can't buy it anywhere else.

147
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,232
We want eighty units.

148
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:28,805
How shall we do this?

149
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,867
I won’t take a penny if...

150
00:16:35,141 --> 00:16:39,465
General Hou supports our railway into Dengfeng.

151
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:54,429
What did you say? I didn't hear properly.

152
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:57,322
I said, I won't take a penny...

153
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,146
If you support the building of our railway.

154
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:04,548
I don't want the guns anymore.

155
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:05,560
General.

156
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,352
I don't want the guns anymore!

157
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:17,100
Go, we head to the city's east.

158
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:23,766
I believe, General Song Hu will show more interest.

159
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:28,071
Mr. Peter, please wait.

160
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:34,026
Brother, this gun is truly marvellous.

161
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:37,310
If Song Hu takes them...

162
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:43,255
Show them out!

163
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,266
Yes!

164
00:17:44,506 --> 00:17:45,506
Please.

165
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:54,084
Next time, choose your words carefully
when you speak to me.

166
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:56,797
I don't take orders from you.

167
00:17:57,068 --> 00:18:00,430
Maybe when you're in my position, then we'll talk.

168
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,783
You hear what I'm saying?

169
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:06,226
Am I being clear enough?

170
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:32,611
To use the lives of our countrymen
and take the wealth of the people.

171
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:36,385
Agreeing to build their railway...

172
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:41,649
Is like opening the doors for them to take our land.

173
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,243
The land of the Chinese belongs to the people of China.

174
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:49,387
The foreigners' hands reach to take it...

175
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:51,739
I will chop them all off.

176
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,834
I hope Song Hu feels the same.

177
00:18:59,186 --> 00:19:03,179
I don't think you've listened to what I've said.

178
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:07,244
These twenty years, I've called him brother.

179
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:09,595
Do not badmouth him.

180
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:21,257
And even if he is bad, it is not for you to say!

181
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:46,930
I'm dizzy.

182
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:52,096
What the hell are you doing?

183
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:53,206
Eating biscuits.

184
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,217
Biscuits?

185
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:58,111
I'm eating noodles now.

186
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:01,854
You've gone mad from hunger.

187
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:05,458
What do you know? This is called having an idea.

188
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:07,830
Idea? Having an idea? All you know is having ideas.

189
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,502
You might be able to do that, But
how about the people out there?

190
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:12,134
What can they do?

191
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:16,648
In times of famine, Judge Bao would
feed the people with his own stores.

192
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:19,221
What if we became masked avengers?

193
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:22,834
We'll hit back at the warlord's armies.

194
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,898
Brother, why don't we become masked avengers?

195
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:28,440
Masked avengers?

196
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,773
That's right, we'll become avengers that save people.

197
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:35,076
Brother, that's against the rules.

198
00:20:35,086 --> 00:20:36,217
What are you afraid of?

199
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:38,659
When the sky falls, Second Brother will hold it up.

200
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,092
Brother is most generous, am I right?

201
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:43,344
Of course.

202
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:45,485
Of course! Of course!

203
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:50,981
Little Miss, please don't run.

204
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:55,875
- Quickly get up
- Shengnan!

205
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:57,727
Are you injured?

206
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:00,369
What the hell are you doing? Did
I not tell you to hold her hand!?

207
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:01,670
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you watch her!?

208
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,771
- I'm sorry, Master.
- You want to die!?

209
00:21:02,781 --> 00:21:04,473
- I'm sorry.
- Papa.

210
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:08,977
It doesn't hurt anymore, please
don't be angry with her.

211
00:21:08,987 --> 00:21:11,690
I'm sorry, Master. I'm sorry.

212
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,861
Leave us.

213
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:16,464
- Does it hurt?
- How does it feel?

214
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,565
I'm not hurt

215
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:18,666
Are there any injuries?

216
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:20,168
- Let Papa see.
- Papa.

217
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,520
I made a drawing for you.

218
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:27,645
[My daddy likes fighting]

219
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:32,870
Is this Papa?

220
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:38,004
Here, Papa will carry you.

221
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:39,015
Hold on.

222
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:41,298
Is Papa this mean?

223
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,130
Big brother.

224
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:49,986
Hold it for now, give it to me later.

225
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:05,190
I've personally delivered the marriage
contract to Commander Song.

226
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,912
He was very happy.

227
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:10,835
Tomorrow night, Zhongyue Restaurant.

228
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:14,089
Commander Song and wife, their son.

229
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:16,861
Eating begins on the dot.

230
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:33,116
I want to ask you a question.

231
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:40,523
Since Song Hu already knows
that I have Huo Long's gold...

232
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,506
Why does he not ask me about it?

233
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,711
He wants it all.

234
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,704
Including DengFeng City.

235
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,952
The one who strikes first wins.

236
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:05,847
Then this is a good opportunity.

237
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:09,390
Correct.

238
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:17,417
Pick thirty of your finest and make preparations
at the Zhongyue Restaurant.

239
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:29,599
If he's not dead, I can't sleep.

240
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,336
Big brother is wise.

241
00:23:48,537 --> 00:23:51,330
You want to kill Brother Song?

242
00:23:55,713 --> 00:23:59,226
It would be better if you didn't know.

243
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:02,290
Be he is your brother.

244
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:05,032
Please think again.

245
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:10,297
Song Hu wants to take me down.

246
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,071
Do you have any other solution?

247
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,744
Spit it out now, it's not too late.

248
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:20,277
Don't ask me, I don't know.

249
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:27,624
I only have just one request...

250
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:32,628
Don't let your daughter see it.

251
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:34,150
Okay?

252
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:20,513
A mouse?

253
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:26,979
Brother, once we've stolen the
rice, how about noodles next?

254
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:31,093
Could you not call it "stealing"? We are "taking".

255
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:33,155
Then how much are we "taking"?

256
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:35,667
A bag we'll take, two bags we'll also take.

257
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:37,198
Take however much we can.

258
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:38,209
Jinghai.

259
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,573
As masked avengers, we should leave a calling card.

260
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,385
What should we use?

261
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:45,376
How about your shiny head?

262
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:46,387
You!

263
00:26:05,866 --> 00:26:06,866
Rice.

264
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,519
Son, we have rice.

265
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:13,822
Brother, its rice!

266
00:26:14,753 --> 00:26:17,106
The gods have opened their eyes.

267
00:26:17,116 --> 00:26:19,098
Thank you! Thank you!

268
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:21,550
There's rice!

269
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:19,294
Wait until I knock on the table...

270
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,736
You take our daughter to the toilets.

271
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:25,810
Papa, we are here to eat. Why do
we need to go to the toilets?

272
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,112
Listen to Papa now...

273
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:31,716
And Papa will listen to you one day. Don't argue.

274
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,360
This way.

275
00:28:10,082 --> 00:28:11,253
Big Brother.

276
00:28:11,884 --> 00:28:12,885
Sister.

277
00:28:13,115 --> 00:28:15,637
Brother, you're late again.

278
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:17,849
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

279
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,951
Hello, Uncle Song. Hello, Auntie.

280
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:22,383
Wanshan, greet Uncle and Auntie.

281
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:23,394
Uncle.

282
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:24,635
Auntie.

283
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,257
Well behaved.

284
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,889
Really well behaved.

285
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,841
Sirs.

286
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:35,376
The Song family's Young Master was
born in the year of the rabbit.

287
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:36,916
The Hou family's Little Miss was
born in the year of the sheep.

288
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:38,278
A great match.

289
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,893
Moreover, their dates of birth are very auspicious.

290
00:28:42,903 --> 00:28:45,935
Their five elements complimenting,
fortunes will equally flourish.

291
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:47,637
A match made in heaven.

292
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:52,281
I dare say, this match will bring wealth
and fortune to both families.

293
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,784
Together till their hair turns grey.

294
00:28:54,794 --> 00:28:57,957
Thereafter, a hundred children
and a thousand grandchildren.

295
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,227
Great, great.

296
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:04,673
Actually, as Buddhists we talk about
fate being the cause of all things.

297
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,834
Without fate, things do not converge.

298
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:09,007
With fate, I believe...

299
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:11,479
They would have come together sooner or later.

300
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:12,821
So what are we waiting for?

301
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:15,423
Quick, quick, quick! On with the wedding invitations!

302
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,824
What are you so anxious about?

303
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,456
How can I not be?

304
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:21,238
If I were to lose such a wonderful daughter-in-law...

305
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:23,440
Where would I find another one?

306
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,413
Sirs, please exchange invitations.

307
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:29,035
This betrothal is finalised.

308
00:29:30,297 --> 00:29:31,298
Agreed!

309
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:32,429
Here.

310
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:35,392
Congratulations! Congratulations!

311
00:29:35,402 --> 00:29:39,816
Big brother, I'll go settle the marriage rites.

312
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:02,097
Brother, now that we are one family...

313
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:05,420
I can speak my mind.

314
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:08,092
Speak.

315
00:30:10,374 --> 00:30:13,867
How are we going to split Dengfeng City...

316
00:30:13,877 --> 00:30:15,949
Between the two of us?

317
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:18,652
You tell me.

318
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:33,006
Didn't we already settle this? One man, one half.

319
00:30:33,286 --> 00:30:34,728
It's all yours.

320
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:40,653
From today on, Dengfeng City is
not split between you and me.

321
00:30:40,663 --> 00:30:42,954
Only one person will have all the say.

322
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:46,208
This is the most peaceful solution.

323
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,052
What do you mean by this?

324
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:53,655
Brother, I am getting old.

325
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,747
I can't fight any more.

326
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,820
Look at this leg, acting up again.

327
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,353
It's time for me to retire.

328
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:06,136
What's more, we're family now.

329
00:31:06,577 --> 00:31:08,939
Even if I give it to you today...

330
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:12,713
In the future, will it not be left to my son?

331
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:16,596
I've thought it through, I don't lose out.

332
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:21,370
I've held this wine for many years but
could never bring myself to open it.

333
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,873
But today I will. Here, drink!

334
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:27,217
Drink up and this matter is settled.

335
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:34,023
Commander, we've received a secret message.

336
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:54,462
Son, do you need to go pee?

337
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:56,574
No need.

338
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:01,448
Listen to me, ask your mother
to take you to the toilets.

339
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:04,251
Sister, take Shengnan as well.

340
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:08,335
Let's go.

341
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,611
Run.

342
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,721
- Vice Wang.
- Here!

343
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:26,732
Leave us.

344
00:32:27,003 --> 00:32:28,003
Yes.

345
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:58,571
[NOTE: General, be careful.] [Hou Jie has an ambush]

346
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:03,387
You!

347
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:04,877
You bastard!

348
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:09,572
I've always treated you as my own brother.

349
00:33:09,582 --> 00:33:11,314
We conquered the world together.

350
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,445
I would never have thought,
today you wanted to kill me.

351
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:15,978
- Is this true!?
- Enough!

352
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:41,683
Shengnan!

353
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,153
Mama!

354
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:47,238
Mama come quickly!

355
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,780
Go already.

356
00:34:36,423 --> 00:34:37,775
Mama, save me!

357
00:34:45,172 --> 00:34:46,173
Mama.

358
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:58,003
Mama! Mama.

359
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:00,336
Mama.

360
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:03,830
Shengnan! Get out of here, Shengnan!

361
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,731
- Mama.
- Run quickly!

362
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,813
Shengnan! Run quickly!

363
00:35:09,615 --> 00:35:12,947
Run away, Shengnan! Don't look back!

364
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:44,227
Shengnan...

365
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:45,805
General!

366
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,481
Papa! Papa!

367
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:54,483
Shengnan!

368
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:56,824
Stop!

369
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:07,295
Commander! Run!

370
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:08,636
Run!

371
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:20,367
Shengnan!

372
00:37:39,445 --> 00:37:41,337
- Shengnan.
- Papa.

373
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,208
Over there!

374
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:55,937
Kill!

375
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,393
Shengnan, don't be afraid!

376
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,322
Papa... Papa...

377
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:02,830
Papa...

378
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:06,292
Shengnan!

379
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:24,512
Abbot!

380
00:42:25,483 --> 00:42:26,483
Sir! Sir!

381
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:29,246
Please slow down!

382
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,819
Save her! Abbot! Save her!

383
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:33,229
Save her.

384
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:37,494
Save her! Save her!

385
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:38,735
Quick! Save her!

386
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:40,457
Make way! Quickly!

387
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:47,384
Silver needles! Guanyin paste! Hot water!

388
00:42:47,394 --> 00:42:48,394
Hurry!

389
00:42:55,411 --> 00:42:59,074
Shengnan, it'll be alright, it'll be alright.

390
00:42:59,084 --> 00:43:01,146
Shengnan, don't fall asleep. Wake up.

391
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:02,157
Madam!

392
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:06,992
Madam! You are not yet healed! You mustn't run!

393
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:08,713
Please be careful.

394
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:10,705
Shengnan

395
00:43:11,706 --> 00:43:13,418
Shengnan, be good.

396
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,490
Shengnan.

397
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:42,525
Say something to Papa, Say something to Papa.

398
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:45,508
Shengnan, say something to Papa.

399
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,090
Shengnan, say something.

400
00:43:50,813 --> 00:43:53,616
Why did you stop? You can't stop!

401
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:55,517
Hurry up and save her!

402
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:57,599
Do you want me to beg?

403
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,403
Then I'll beg! Save her! Save her!

404
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:06,768
Papa, don't scold them.

405
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,320
And don't be angry with them.

406
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:11,782
Papa will listen.

407
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:14,185
Papa will listen! Papa will listen!

408
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:15,456
I beg of you.

409
00:44:16,937 --> 00:44:17,938
Mama...

410
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:19,569
Shengnan!

411
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,201
She's going to be okay.

412
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:24,815
- Mama, I missed you.
- She's alright!

413
00:44:25,015 --> 00:44:30,630
Mama, let's go home together.

414
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:33,672
Shengnan, wake up.

415
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:34,804
Save her.

416
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:38,397
I'm begging all of you.

417
00:44:38,907 --> 00:44:40,979
Only you can save her.

418
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,242
Shengnan, wake up.

419
00:44:43,252 --> 00:44:45,614
Say something to Mama, Shengnan.

420
00:44:45,624 --> 00:44:46,625
Shengnan.

421
00:44:46,856 --> 00:44:47,856
Shengnan!

422
00:44:49,828 --> 00:44:52,701
Shengnan!

423
00:44:55,773 --> 00:44:57,124
She's alright.

424
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:02,649
Say something to Papa, say something to Papa.

425
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:04,371
She can't be dead.

426
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:07,064
Shengnan! Shengnan!

427
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:12,599
Please wake up, you can't die.

428
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,031
Shengnan can't die.

429
00:45:14,041 --> 00:45:16,563
Mama is here, look at Mama.

430
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:19,115
Jinghai, receive the body.

431
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:21,217
- Yes.
- She can't be dead!

432
00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:23,119
I beg you! Save her!

433
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,060
I beg you.

434
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:28,264
I beg you. Save her.

435
00:45:31,477 --> 00:45:36,161
Quickly save her. Abbot have compassion, save her!

436
00:45:37,252 --> 00:45:40,755
If you can't save her, I'll tell you now!

437
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:43,388
Don't none of you ever think of living!

438
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:45,731
I will burn Shaolin temple to the ground!

439
00:45:45,741 --> 00:45:48,162
- Abbot, save her!
- Enough!

440
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:49,173
Amitabha.

441
00:45:49,774 --> 00:45:53,278
Have the gods not yet punished you enough!?

442
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:54,819
It's your fault!

443
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:56,700
She's not dead!

444
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,682
I am full of regret!

445
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:00,334
She is not dead.

446
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:02,156
- If it wasn't for you...
- She is fine.

447
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,868
How can my daughter be dead!?

448
00:46:05,008 --> 00:46:06,630
Look! She's dead!

449
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,272
She's not dead.

450
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:09,573
- She can't see anything anymore!
- She's not dead!

451
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,144
She's not dead, you understand!?

452
00:46:11,154 --> 00:46:14,307
The one who should be dead is you!

453
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:18,330
Shengnan.

454
00:46:22,745 --> 00:46:24,417
Mama is sorry.

455
00:46:25,988 --> 00:46:27,699
She can't be dead.

456
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,032
She's not dead.

457
00:46:30,963 --> 00:46:31,964
Save her!

458
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:35,627
You speak of compassion! How
could you just watch her die!?

459
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:37,619
Fine! Don't save her!

460
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:41,202
I will kill each and every last one of you.

461
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:44,545
I'll start with this damned old man.

462
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:49,189
- Sir!
- I'll kill you all!

463
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,402
I'll kill you all!

464
00:46:52,403 --> 00:46:53,404
Sir!

465
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,049
Sir!

466
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,811
Restrain him!

467
00:47:14,273 --> 00:47:15,985
I'll kill you all!

468
00:47:26,364 --> 00:47:28,977
I'm going to kill you all...

469
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:02,344
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

470
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:05,417
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

471
00:49:05,427 --> 00:49:08,491
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

472
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,923
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

473
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:14,996
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

474
00:49:16,178 --> 00:49:17,708
Leave Shaolin...

475
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,453
This one doesn't count.

476
00:49:22,824 --> 00:49:25,886
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

477
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:27,598
Leave Shaolin...

478
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,920
Is anyone there!?

479
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,293
I set a trap for pigs, how come a man is here?

480
00:49:43,303 --> 00:49:46,725
What are you up to, covered in blood?

481
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:50,039
I know you, you are that Hou Jie.

482
00:49:50,049 --> 00:49:52,041
You still want to kill people?

483
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:54,713
When a man is without common sense
is when they are worse than pigs.

484
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:58,047
Given you're in this situation, best lie still.

485
00:49:58,057 --> 00:49:59,138
Don't howl.

486
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:02,490
Relax a bit, I'll be back later.

487
00:50:04,703 --> 00:50:05,704
Amitabha.

488
00:50:52,498 --> 00:50:54,569
Hey, something to eat.

489
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:56,381
Careful, it's hot.

490
00:50:58,313 --> 00:51:01,916
Cool on the outside, hot on the inside.

491
00:51:14,008 --> 00:51:16,260
Why has it come to this?

492
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,211
Why?

493
00:51:31,373 --> 00:51:33,466
Your wife has left Shaolin.

494
00:51:33,476 --> 00:51:37,620
Your daughter's funeral has been left to you.

495
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:04,865
Will it be a burial or cremation?

496
00:52:07,447 --> 00:52:09,810
The Abbot asked me to ask you.

497
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,784
With burials, you can see them on holidays.

498
00:52:15,195 --> 00:52:17,357
But who can really see them?

499
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,959
I guess you can dig them out but that's not easy either.

500
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:23,393
I think cremation is more convenient.

501
00:52:23,712 --> 00:52:27,066
You can see them anytime and take
them with you if you move.

502
00:52:27,076 --> 00:52:29,058
To where ever you go.

503
00:52:29,118 --> 00:52:33,532
I think cremation is better. What do you think?

504
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,211
If its cremation...

505
00:52:44,182 --> 00:52:50,218
Then after you've finished your
noodles, we'll go light the fire.

506
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:10,997
Take all this and burn it!

507
00:53:22,729 --> 00:53:24,580
So you'd rather die than submit?

508
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:28,554
At least I'll see Brother in the afterlife.

509
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:30,506
Fire!

510
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:34,739
When you were being hunted...

511
00:53:34,749 --> 00:53:37,512
It was Big Brother who saved you.

512
00:53:37,522 --> 00:53:39,844
Who would have thought...

513
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:43,278
You'd repay his kindness with hatred!

514
00:53:43,868 --> 00:53:45,490
What is kindness?

515
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,936
He didn't save me, he used me.

516
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,781
I've known that for a long time now, he needed me.

517
00:53:57,791 --> 00:54:01,284
In battle, it was I that killed the most people.

518
00:54:01,294 --> 00:54:04,828
Was there a bit of land I didn't help him conquer?

519
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:07,631
Then why did I betray Hou Jie?

520
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:11,544
Answer correctly and I will spare you.

521
00:54:11,554 --> 00:54:12,555
Because...

522
00:54:14,327 --> 00:54:15,678
You are a dog!

523
00:54:22,645 --> 00:54:23,905
Wrong answer.

524
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,867
I betrayed him, because he was afraid.

525
00:54:37,238 --> 00:54:39,490
With fear, comes defeat.

526
00:54:40,971 --> 00:54:42,593
He deserved this.

527
00:54:44,385 --> 00:54:46,276
Now begins my reign.

528
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,558
You understand?

529
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:20,178
The streets are filled with them, everywhere
with wanted posters.

530
00:55:20,188 --> 00:55:23,181
Actually, it's the same whoever captures you.

531
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:25,383
Anyway, I've to make rice for you again.

532
00:55:25,393 --> 00:55:29,447
Otherwise, I'll have made fifty thousand silvers now.

533
00:55:29,457 --> 00:55:31,348
[WANTED: Hou Jie] [REWARD: Ten thousand silvers]

534
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,331
Eh? It's now a hundred thousand.

535
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:37,745
Just kidding.

536
00:55:37,985 --> 00:55:43,090
Shaolin temple preaches compassion,
I wouldn't do that to you.

537
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,271
So what now?

538
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:49,446
I don't want to leave.

539
00:55:49,506 --> 00:55:53,199
You can't treat this place as your home.

540
00:56:20,165 --> 00:56:21,336
What's this?

541
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,928
Throwing a tantrum?

542
00:56:23,938 --> 00:56:25,649
Made up your mind?

543
00:57:24,104 --> 00:57:25,545
Want some help?

544
00:57:29,189 --> 00:57:31,261
- Brother.
- Brother.

545
00:57:36,526 --> 00:57:39,488
There is suddenly a lot more rice in the kitchens.

546
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,390
How did this happen?

547
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:43,202
A lot more rice?

548
00:57:47,015 --> 00:57:50,259
Oh! Our prayers have been answered!

549
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,762
Amitabha, amitabha, amitabha.

550
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,656
Then you better ask Buddha...

551
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:01,469
Why there are shadow men jumping
about on the rooftops at night?

552
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:02,560
Shadow men?

553
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:06,544
How can there be shadow men at the temple?

554
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:09,116
They came to steal the rice.

555
00:58:09,126 --> 00:58:14,081
It's to steal the rice back here, not steal the rice.

556
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:21,739
All involved present to the training grounds
after morning lessons for your punishment!

557
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,550
Yes, Elder Brother.

558
00:58:37,513 --> 00:58:38,514
You again!

559
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:43,018
What the hell do you want?

560
00:58:43,028 --> 00:58:44,029
Amitabha.

561
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:45,890
Master.

562
00:58:50,806 --> 00:58:53,868
Abbot, I want to stay at Shaolin.

563
00:58:54,048 --> 00:58:55,440
That's not for you to decide.

564
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,841
You are now wanted.

565
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:59,734
Isn't so you can avoid capture?

566
00:59:01,795 --> 00:59:03,718
I've decided to become a monk.

567
00:59:03,728 --> 00:59:08,462
Shaolin will not become your battlefield,
The decision is not yours to make.

568
00:59:08,472 --> 00:59:10,604
Return to whence you came.

569
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:14,837
Did the Abbot not say once, "Buddha sends the fated"?

570
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:17,010
Who says you are fated?

571
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,461
Master.

572
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:24,757
You'll only receive his body,
you won't receive his heart.

573
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:27,670
His sins are great. He is a warlord, Master.

574
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,874
Master, a person like him will sully
the name of Shaolin Temple.

575
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:35,397
There is the essence of Buddha in all.

576
00:59:35,528 --> 00:59:38,049
We should not discriminate.

577
00:59:39,731 --> 00:59:43,195
Everything is empty, only fate is with substance.

578
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:47,839
His heart is full of hatred and revenge,
it will not receive the enlightenment.

579
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:48,850
Well said.

580
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:54,615
But we cannot deny the teachings
of Buddha by closing the way.

581
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:56,877
Nor can we, if we tried.

582
00:59:56,897 --> 01:00:01,201
Troublesome is the Bodhi, since
understanding is confusing.

583
01:00:01,211 --> 01:00:03,584
The old ways are dying.

584
01:00:04,585 --> 01:00:08,278
I think, we should let him stay for now.

585
01:00:13,934 --> 01:00:17,356
The Abbot has dumped you on me again?

586
01:00:17,436 --> 01:00:19,098
But being in Shaolin is alright.

587
01:00:19,108 --> 01:00:22,341
Out there, it's a dog eat dog world.

588
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:23,612
Wait outside.

589
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:27,386
New Baldy, it's cold, wear this.

590
01:00:27,396 --> 01:00:28,567
Off to work!

591
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:37,745
- Amitabha!
- Morning.

[PLAQUE: The Source of All Martial
Arts] [GRAFFITI: Empty words.]

593
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:52,159
Mantous are here! Make way!

594
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:56,633
Make way! Mantous are here!

595
01:00:58,355 --> 01:00:59,976
Line up! Line up!

596
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:09,876
Thank you.

597
01:01:11,748 --> 01:01:13,279
Not so hard, eh?

598
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,241
Not hard.

599
01:01:16,922 --> 01:01:20,616
Don't push, don't push. Plenty, plenty.

600
01:01:28,413 --> 01:01:33,728
Strike without the fist being seen. Not the way if it is.

601
01:01:36,091 --> 01:01:37,982
Practice to the Way.

602
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:40,274
Actions are fluid.

603
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:43,558
Know the fine.

604
01:01:43,878 --> 01:01:45,589
Awaken to the Zen.

605
01:02:52,742 --> 01:02:54,694
Quickly bring the wooden container to hold the food!

606
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:55,705
Okay.

607
01:03:17,185 --> 01:03:18,186
Hey.

608
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:20,548
Have you practised before?

609
01:03:20,558 --> 01:03:21,559
What?

610
01:03:21,559 --> 01:03:23,360
- Kungfu
- Kungfu?

611
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:28,136
Truth is, when I was younger I trained for two years.

612
01:03:28,146 --> 01:03:31,748
But like you, my heart was not focused.

613
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:34,672
So I worked in the kitchen.

614
01:03:35,793 --> 01:03:39,215
You want to learn, learn the Dharma.

615
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:40,667
Dharma.

616
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:44,190
Faced the wall for nine years.

617
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,873
What was he refining? The heart.

618
01:03:46,883 --> 01:03:50,446
Without conflict, gained wisdom
from every inch of his body.

619
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:54,179
The thoughts from his hair is as the hair on our head.

620
01:03:54,189 --> 01:03:57,163
This level is called the Zen Wu.

621
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:26,887
Let's practise together.

622
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:31,741
Fists and heart as one.

623
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,265
Elbows and knees as one.

624
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:39,458
Shoulders and hips as one.

625
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:42,001
Heart and mind as one.

626
01:05:42,461 --> 01:05:44,623
Mind and breath as one.

627
01:05:44,943 --> 01:05:47,235
Breath and strength as one.

628
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:49,137
Practise to the Way.

629
01:05:49,718 --> 01:05:51,429
Actions are fluid.

630
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:53,501
Move with feeling.

631
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:55,774
Know the fine.

632
01:05:57,095 --> 01:05:58,806
Awaken to the Zen.

633
01:06:01,869 --> 01:06:03,040
Stay strong!

634
01:06:04,212 --> 01:06:07,804
They're hopping down, we're squatting
down. Both ways build strength.

635
01:06:07,814 --> 01:06:09,166
Straighten up!

636
01:06:23,249 --> 01:06:25,501
Hold down this meridian.

637
01:06:26,923 --> 01:06:28,544
It'll be alright.

638
01:06:41,647 --> 01:06:43,088
You go now, go.

639
01:06:44,779 --> 01:06:45,780
For you.

640
01:07:52,182 --> 01:07:55,315
The weather is cold, why are you not inside resting?

641
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:58,458
Precisely because it is cold, I am here practising.

642
01:07:58,468 --> 01:07:59,729
Are you cold?

643
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,922
A little.

644
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:04,414
Then practice with me.

645
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,216
Okay.

646
01:09:03,459 --> 01:09:06,161
Abbot, his form is a bit off.

647
01:09:08,163 --> 01:09:12,938
From the heart it follows, from thoughts give rise.

648
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:15,871
He is fine as he is.

649
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:23,248
In practising martial arts, the vengeance
in his heart is released.

650
01:09:23,258 --> 01:09:26,591
I do not practise martial arts, this I do not understand.

651
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:31,365
Practising martial arts is Zen, cooking is also Zen.

652
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:34,709
The principles are roughly the same.

653
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:40,654
Wudao, the most important things
in life are experience and practise.

654
01:09:40,664 --> 01:09:42,787
I've said it many times.

655
01:09:42,797 --> 01:09:46,660
Leave Shaolin Temple, go see the world outside.

656
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:48,231
All I know is how to cook.

657
01:09:48,241 --> 01:09:50,433
Out there, I'm of no use.

658
01:09:50,443 --> 01:09:51,794
I'm not going.

659
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:55,188
A piece of gold and a pile of dirt.

660
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,290
Which has more use?

661
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,851
I guess the piece of gold.

662
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,203
And if I gave you a seed?

663
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:04,507
Don't sell yourself short.

664
01:10:05,577 --> 01:10:08,910
Everyone is useful in their own way.

665
01:10:43,382 --> 01:10:47,887
Cao Man, you want us to help the foreigners build the railway.

666
01:10:47,897 --> 01:10:52,021
But you mustn't forget, Mangshan is
the resting place of our ancestors.

667
01:10:52,031 --> 01:10:55,665
Disturb the soil and you break the Feng Shui.

668
01:10:55,675 --> 01:10:59,277
The ancestors will never agree to this!

669
01:11:00,188 --> 01:11:03,682
If you are really going to do it, I have nothing to say.

670
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:06,915
I'm just worried that the foreigners are playing us...

671
01:11:06,925 --> 01:11:09,988
And making deals under the table.

672
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:16,484
Cao Man, your betrayal of Hou...

673
01:11:18,086 --> 01:11:19,347
We don't care.

674
01:11:19,357 --> 01:11:22,749
He previously said, building the railway is just a cover.

675
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,192
It's true intent is to take our land.

676
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:27,465
Okay, okay, okay. Say no more.

677
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:31,338
Henan Province's interests are not for one man to decide.

678
01:11:31,348 --> 01:11:35,241
But looking at Cao Man's attitude, it seems he's already
made an agreement with the foreigners.

679
01:11:35,251 --> 01:11:38,764
There was no intention to hear us out.

680
01:11:39,696 --> 01:11:40,697
Go.

681
01:12:10,084 --> 01:12:13,327
Listen well. Standing in my way...

682
01:12:14,858 --> 01:12:17,651
Is not in your best interests.

683
01:12:17,771 --> 01:12:19,573
They are fortunate.

684
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,985
But their families...

685
01:12:22,445 --> 01:12:24,868
Will die much more horrible deaths.

686
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:28,751
Whether to become my friend or my enemy...

687
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:31,134
Is for you to decide.

688
01:12:35,838 --> 01:12:37,099
Have a think.

689
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:41,904
If there is money to be made, no one loses out.

690
01:12:51,502 --> 01:12:55,467
What do we do now? He hasn't returned yet.

691
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,212
Don't cry, Aunt. Okay?

692
01:13:03,855 --> 01:13:06,256
Crying won't bring him back any sooner.

693
01:13:06,967 --> 01:13:08,619
What has happened?

694
01:13:08,829 --> 01:13:13,233
Master, our Daniel has been gone
for over twenty days now.

695
01:13:13,243 --> 01:13:14,784
What should we do?

696
01:13:14,794 --> 01:13:16,937
[NOTICE: Seeking all able men aged 16 to
40 for work on the Zhengsong railway.]

697
01:13:16,947 --> 01:13:18,979
Cao Man is building a railway?

698
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:21,020
Our family depends on him.

699
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,322
Work quickly, on pain of death.

700
01:13:33,512 --> 01:13:34,514
You hear?

701
01:13:36,655 --> 01:13:38,096
Faster! Faster!

702
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:09,005
Who's there!?

703
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:12,829
What the hell are you up to?

704
01:14:17,864 --> 01:14:20,496
Why did you kill so many people?

705
01:14:20,506 --> 01:14:23,729
It was... It was Commander Cao's orders.

706
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:24,740
Leave.

707
01:14:26,682 --> 01:14:27,682
Leave!

708
01:14:28,323 --> 01:14:32,197
Hou Jie still lives! Hou Jie still lives!

709
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:43,918
Let's go.

710
01:14:49,823 --> 01:14:52,156
Cao Man lied to us about building the railway.

711
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:55,659
Who knew he was really digging
for artifacts for the foreigners.

712
01:14:55,669 --> 01:14:58,912
Each one we found, we gave to them.

713
01:14:59,482 --> 01:15:02,446
In exchange for guns and cannons.

714
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:08,131
He was worried it might leak it
out, so he had them silenced.

715
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,713
The Cao Villa still holds many of our brothers.

716
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:26,858
At the end of tomorrow's work, they will all be killed.

717
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,721
I am sorry.

718
01:15:32,143 --> 01:15:33,144
Go home.

719
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:35,346
Quick! We're going.

720
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:25,834
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

721
01:16:29,257 --> 01:16:30,698
Go have a look.

722
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:34,291
How could this be!?

723
01:17:17,712 --> 01:17:21,946
In life till now, committed terrible crimes...

724
01:17:22,086 --> 01:17:25,600
All stemming from the greed of man.

725
01:17:27,901 --> 01:17:29,883
The actions of one...

726
01:17:31,745 --> 01:17:35,438
Today begs for the Buddha's forgiveness.

727
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:39,453
Evil came to trouble the mind...

728
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:40,554
Enough!

729
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:46,139
Hereon will trouble no more.

730
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,012
Shengnan!

731
01:17:50,643 --> 01:17:53,406
Corruption is without value...

732
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:56,118
How can my daughter be dead!?

733
01:17:56,788 --> 01:17:59,431
Purity without excess.

734
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:12,133
Forget bygones with one cut, one cut to sever all.

735
01:18:13,854 --> 01:18:17,188
Then will you understand all that is before you.

736
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:21,632
From today on, this rite bestows the Three Jewels.

737
01:18:21,642 --> 01:18:23,804
The Buddha is realised.

738
01:18:24,144 --> 01:18:26,396
The Way is straightened.

739
01:18:26,846 --> 01:18:28,828
The monk is at peace.

740
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:35,635
Hereon, you will be known by this order as Jingjue.

741
01:18:37,096 --> 01:18:39,409
Amitabha.

742
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:41,880
Amitabha.

743
01:18:56,784 --> 01:18:58,726
Capture Hou Jie alive!

744
01:18:58,737 --> 01:19:00,228
Capture Hou Jie alive!

745
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:02,310
Capture Hou Jie alive!

746
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:18,545
Sir!

747
01:19:36,892 --> 01:19:39,886
It's Cao Man! I'm going to stop him!

748
01:19:39,896 --> 01:19:41,246
Get back here!

749
01:19:43,168 --> 01:19:44,169
Calm down.

750
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:49,754
He's come at a good time.

751
01:19:50,845 --> 01:19:53,708
Seize the moment, I will take him back.

752
01:19:53,718 --> 01:19:56,510
After sunset, go to Cao Villa.

753
01:19:56,891 --> 01:19:58,022
Rescue the people.

754
01:19:58,032 --> 01:19:59,033
You'll go?

755
01:19:59,664 --> 01:20:01,626
You are walking to your own death.

756
01:20:01,636 --> 01:20:05,139
If my life can be exchanged for countless others...

757
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:06,500
What is death?

758
01:20:08,312 --> 01:20:11,014
Jingjue, you must be careful.

759
01:20:35,207 --> 01:20:36,378
Nobody move!

760
01:20:57,147 --> 01:20:59,940
- Nobody move!
- Nobody move!

761
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:08,368
Amitabha.

762
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:30,269
Please Sir, release the meat cleaver.

763
01:21:30,279 --> 01:21:35,864
Continue committing sins and suffer
disastrous consequences.

764
01:21:45,573 --> 01:21:47,916
That was for my daughter.

765
01:21:48,245 --> 01:21:49,246
Amitabha.

766
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:53,060
That sure is my Big Brother.

767
01:21:53,891 --> 01:21:57,224
I knew you wouldn't die that easily.

768
01:21:58,265 --> 01:22:01,258
Brother, I thought of you terribly.

769
01:22:01,268 --> 01:22:02,619
Thought of me?

770
01:22:06,482 --> 01:22:08,775
If I don't die, you can't sleep, right?

771
01:22:08,785 --> 01:22:10,676
Don't be ridiculous.

772
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:13,309
Nothing of the sort.

773
01:22:16,492 --> 01:22:17,844
Don't pretend.

774
01:22:19,174 --> 01:22:22,417
You're afraid I will take you down.

775
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:36,691
Jingjue's actions are to give us an opportunity...

776
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,032
So we can save lives.

777
01:22:38,042 --> 01:22:39,734
Your impulsiveness will ruin the plan.

778
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,275
You understand!?

779
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:54,648
You once taught me...

780
01:22:54,808 --> 01:23:00,573
Gain the upper hand and you hesitate a moment
too long, the one dead will be you.

781
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:01,845
I remembered.

782
01:23:08,431 --> 01:23:11,853
Pull back your men, I'll go with you.

783
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:32,103
String the Abbot up.

784
01:23:32,113 --> 01:23:35,576
Do anything rash and I'll send him to the gods.

785
01:23:35,586 --> 01:23:38,829
No objections, everyone stand down.

786
01:23:48,377 --> 01:23:49,379
Come then.

787
01:24:09,718 --> 01:24:14,052
You promised to have these at Zhengzhou before dawn.

788
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:18,566
With Cao's troops, no one will dare block our way.

789
01:24:18,706 --> 01:24:20,238
Remain vigilant.

790
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,012
Make way! Make way!

791
01:24:42,478 --> 01:24:45,181
Get down! I'm talking to you!

792
01:24:46,953 --> 01:24:47,953
Get down!

793
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:50,126
Quickly!

794
01:24:52,138 --> 01:24:53,579
Get in quickly!

795
01:24:57,142 --> 01:25:02,367
Big brother, isn't this place more beautiful than before?

796
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:04,809
You bring me here...

797
01:25:06,061 --> 01:25:09,844
Wasn't just for me to praise you, was it?

798
01:25:10,234 --> 01:25:11,586
Of course not.

799
01:25:12,236 --> 01:25:15,119
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

800
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:20,574
I hope that Brother will once again take me in.

801
01:25:20,584 --> 01:25:24,948
Conquering the world and achieving great things.

802
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:26,489
Brother, look...

803
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:29,893
This was all for your sake.

804
01:25:29,973 --> 01:25:31,595
This throne is yours.

805
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:34,667
This imperial robe is also yours.

806
01:25:41,163 --> 01:25:42,164
Brother.

807
01:25:44,497 --> 01:25:48,910
Is money and power really that important to you?

808
01:25:52,654 --> 01:25:53,916
Listen to me.

809
01:25:55,186 --> 01:25:57,168
Don't become like me.

810
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,244
Faking compassion?

811
01:26:05,406 --> 01:26:07,749
I was messing with you...

812
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:12,042
To see how you would play along!

813
01:26:12,052 --> 01:26:14,014
I have a gift for you.

814
01:26:14,024 --> 01:26:15,826
Bring her out here!

815
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:54,192
I found him for you, Sister.

816
01:26:54,202 --> 01:26:58,436
I spared her, so man and wife can be reunited.

817
01:27:15,232 --> 01:27:16,233
Get down!

818
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,700
About face!

819
01:27:54,338 --> 01:27:55,869
You've suffered.

820
01:28:00,534 --> 01:28:03,416
I used to think I was powerful.

821
01:28:04,307 --> 01:28:07,371
I could take care of both of you.

822
01:28:08,552 --> 01:28:11,164
But instead, I destroyed us.

823
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:32,914
Ready guns!

824
01:28:35,437 --> 01:28:36,608
Don't shoot!

825
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:41,662
Raise arms!

826
01:28:46,927 --> 01:28:47,928
Fire!

827
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,901
Fire!

828
01:28:52,103 --> 01:28:54,085
Guards stay! The rest follow me!

829
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,095
Yes!

830
01:29:09,798 --> 01:29:12,141
Master, save us! Save us!

831
01:29:18,056 --> 01:29:20,209
You men! Go see what's happening!

832
01:29:20,219 --> 01:29:21,220
Yes!

833
01:29:37,685 --> 01:29:41,739
The artifacts are being stolen! After them!

834
01:29:51,348 --> 01:29:52,699
Out of my way!

835
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:37,672
Hou Jie!

836
01:30:38,242 --> 01:30:39,593
Let go of her!

837
01:30:41,314 --> 01:30:42,666
Let go of her!

838
01:30:43,947 --> 01:30:45,299
You're crying!

839
01:30:46,759 --> 01:30:47,840
Let her go!

840
01:30:48,261 --> 01:30:50,063
Your death alone...

841
01:30:50,994 --> 01:30:52,616
Won't satisfy me.

842
01:30:54,106 --> 01:30:56,298
You watched your daughter die...

843
01:30:56,308 --> 01:30:59,822
Now I want you to watch your wife die.

844
01:30:59,882 --> 01:31:01,773
Then I can be happy.

845
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:10,522
You animal! Let her go!

846
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:11,613
Let her go!

847
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:22,784
Sister is very pretty. What a shame...

848
01:31:22,794 --> 01:31:24,234
You are a monk.

849
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:37,077
Cao Man! Stop it!

850
01:31:44,464 --> 01:31:47,666
Commander! Shaolin monks have stolen the artifacts!

851
01:31:47,676 --> 01:31:52,001
Attacked the prison and released the prisoners!

852
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:04,302
You deceived me.

853
01:32:06,064 --> 01:32:07,065
Kill him.

854
01:32:38,044 --> 01:32:39,215
Jingjue! Go!

855
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:44,901
Go quickly.

856
01:33:21,155 --> 01:33:22,156
Go!

857
01:33:30,243 --> 01:33:31,684
Eldest brother!

858
01:33:52,894 --> 01:33:53,895
Go!

859
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:00,331
Go!

860
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:01,802
Go!

861
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,511
Eldest brother!

862
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:12,522
Go!

863
01:34:13,824 --> 01:34:14,825
Go!

864
01:34:15,925 --> 01:34:17,367
Eldest brother!

865
01:34:26,485 --> 01:34:30,809
Eldest brother! Eldest brother! Eldest brother!

866
01:34:31,059 --> 01:34:33,942
You won't listen to my orders!?

867
01:34:34,863 --> 01:34:35,864
Go!

868
01:34:38,877 --> 01:34:39,878
Go!

869
01:34:40,779 --> 01:34:44,202
Go! We'll escort the villagers first!

870
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:30,862
What do you want?

871
01:36:30,872 --> 01:36:32,043
Back inside!

872
01:36:35,647 --> 01:36:36,648
Abbot.

873
01:36:37,449 --> 01:36:38,979
Get back inside.

874
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:46,967
Hey!

875
01:36:47,007 --> 01:36:48,899
Little monk, don't force me.

876
01:36:48,909 --> 01:36:50,901
I warn you to go back inside now.

877
01:36:50,911 --> 01:36:53,703
I don't want to kill children.

878
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:13,782
Sir, please show compassion.

879
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:15,443
Let us save the Abbot.

880
01:37:15,453 --> 01:37:18,877
You will attain wealth and happiness.

881
01:37:24,142 --> 01:37:26,484
Sir, Abbot always said...

882
01:37:26,614 --> 01:37:29,107
A brave man is one who knows to
return after having lost his way.

883
01:37:29,117 --> 01:37:31,368
Put it down and go home.

884
01:37:31,488 --> 01:37:35,182
I'm sure your family is waiting for you.

885
01:37:49,686 --> 01:37:50,687
Insolence!

886
01:37:51,258 --> 01:37:53,689
Want to rebel? Catch them!

887
01:38:10,735 --> 01:38:11,736
Amitabha.

888
01:38:19,844 --> 01:38:22,177
I don't want to fight! I don't know kungfu!

889
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:23,187
Amitabha.

890
01:38:40,423 --> 01:38:41,775
Stop fighting!

891
01:38:42,596 --> 01:38:45,207
Don't want to fight anymore!

892
01:38:58,561 --> 01:39:01,172
I'll fight you with my life!

893
01:39:16,957 --> 01:39:17,958
Abbot!

894
01:39:18,429 --> 01:39:19,690
Are you hurt?

895
01:39:28,347 --> 01:39:32,852
Uncle! Toss them like you were frying vegetables!

896
01:39:48,757 --> 01:39:52,991
Uncle! Beat them like you were kneading dough!

897
01:40:17,114 --> 01:40:18,375
Uncle! Great!

898
01:40:19,246 --> 01:40:20,958
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

899
01:40:21,338 --> 01:40:22,869
Are you alright?

900
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,892
We must get inside quickly.

901
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:27,254
- Okay.
- Go.

902
01:40:48,533 --> 01:40:49,534
It's them!

903
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:56,791
Huzi!

904
01:41:01,826 --> 01:41:02,827
Mother!

905
01:41:09,463 --> 01:41:10,464
Father!

906
01:41:29,112 --> 01:41:32,534
Jingneng's sacrifice was not in vain.

907
01:41:32,855 --> 01:41:35,698
Don't be too attached.

908
01:41:54,765 --> 01:41:59,449
Sirs and Madams, please ready and pack your things.

909
01:41:59,669 --> 01:42:02,462
We are leaving Shaolin Temple.

910
01:42:19,308 --> 01:42:21,381
I know you are scared.

911
01:42:22,681 --> 01:42:23,942
But I am not.

912
01:42:25,494 --> 01:42:30,859
Because my loved ones are gone,
my family is already lost.

913
01:42:30,869 --> 01:42:33,031
Who wouldn't be scared?

914
01:42:37,985 --> 01:42:39,607
These few days...

915
01:42:40,989 --> 01:42:43,991
I felt just like you...

916
01:42:46,233 --> 01:42:49,206
Shaolin Temple is a happy place.

917
01:42:49,507 --> 01:42:51,668
It has become our home.

918
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:55,272
Shaolin Temple might...

919
01:42:56,183 --> 01:42:57,985
Meet its end today.

920
01:43:00,026 --> 01:43:02,639
But the spirit of Shaolin...

921
01:43:02,899 --> 01:43:05,872
Every flower and blade of grass...

922
01:43:05,882 --> 01:43:08,434
Its beams and columns, its bricks and tiles...

923
01:43:08,444 --> 01:43:11,417
Will forever stay in our hearts.

924
01:43:11,918 --> 01:43:14,169
The spirit of Shaolin...

925
01:43:15,451 --> 01:43:19,144
Taught me to persevere and show courage.

926
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,807
To never abandon hope.

927
01:43:26,591 --> 01:43:31,095
I ask you all to live your lives as best you can.

928
01:44:15,056 --> 01:44:16,618
I have a favour to ask of you.

929
01:44:16,628 --> 01:44:17,629
What?

930
01:44:20,702 --> 01:44:23,134
You lead them out of here.

931
01:44:24,215 --> 01:44:26,167
I have never left Shaolin Temple.

932
01:44:26,177 --> 01:44:28,430
No, no, no. I'm scared.

933
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:31,102
You're scared?

934
01:44:31,362 --> 01:44:32,623
Look at them.

935
01:44:33,534 --> 01:44:34,886
They need you.

936
01:44:36,566 --> 01:44:39,359
They are more scared than you.

937
01:44:41,782 --> 01:44:43,763
I... Let me think...

938
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:51,650
Fine.

939
01:44:53,302 --> 01:44:54,303
I'll go.

940
01:45:30,307 --> 01:45:31,698
We must distract them.

941
01:45:31,708 --> 01:45:34,541
We must escort the villagers up the mountain.

942
01:45:34,551 --> 01:45:37,013
Jinghai, take the Abbot first.

943
01:45:37,023 --> 01:45:39,015
Jingkong, you lead. I'll catch up.

944
01:45:39,025 --> 01:45:41,868
- Move quickly!
- I'll fight them with my life!

945
01:45:41,878 --> 01:45:42,879
Quickly!

946
01:45:43,769 --> 01:45:45,031
Move quickly!

947
01:47:03,925 --> 01:47:05,006
Go quickly!

948
01:47:29,398 --> 01:47:32,932
You bastards! Want to destroy Shaolin!?

949
01:47:32,942 --> 01:47:34,564
I'll destroy you!

950
01:48:41,456 --> 01:48:43,798
Cao Man, wake up already.

951
01:48:46,501 --> 01:48:51,275
You must know, you've always had more than you need.

952
01:48:52,376 --> 01:48:55,620
Put it down, discontinue this path.

953
01:48:59,493 --> 01:49:03,727
We are in a war, it has always been like this.

954
01:49:03,737 --> 01:49:05,358
Don't be like me.

955
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:10,514
I've come to realise my past crimes.

956
01:49:14,026 --> 01:49:15,618
It's time to stop.

957
01:49:15,628 --> 01:49:17,430
Could we not fight?

958
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,612
What do you think?

959
01:50:31,669 --> 01:50:32,670
I yield.

960
01:51:59,571 --> 01:52:01,013
Shaolin Temple?

961
01:52:28,168 --> 01:52:31,772
Shaolin Temple will not be dishonoured.

962
01:52:44,093 --> 01:52:47,437
Buddha is compassionate.

963
01:53:10,008 --> 01:53:12,109
Madam! You can't leave! It's dangerous outside!

964
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:14,011
Abbot! My child is missing!

965
01:53:14,021 --> 01:53:15,913
My child is missing!

966
01:53:16,724 --> 01:53:17,725
Mama!

967
01:53:33,981 --> 01:53:36,052
- Brother!
- Brother!

968
01:53:37,033 --> 01:53:38,214
Quick! Quick!

969
01:53:38,224 --> 01:53:39,225
Brother...

970
01:53:40,777 --> 01:53:41,778
Brother!

971
01:53:50,265 --> 01:53:52,517
- Brother!
- Jinghai...

972
01:53:52,798 --> 01:53:53,799
Brother!

973
01:53:59,844 --> 01:54:03,178
Amitabha.

974
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:07,632
- Brother!
- Brother!

975
01:54:07,642 --> 01:54:08,643
Brother!

976
01:54:08,933 --> 01:54:11,005
- Brother!
- Brother!

977
01:54:11,696 --> 01:54:17,461
I will stay behind! You all must
deliver the villagers safely!

978
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:43,551
It's time you woke up...

979
01:56:14,590 --> 01:56:15,852
Hold onto me!

980
01:56:51,195 --> 01:56:53,167
Amitabha.

981
01:57:00,183 --> 01:57:02,886
Evil is borne from the heart.

982
01:57:03,686 --> 01:57:04,687
Repent.

983
01:58:12,821 --> 01:58:13,822
Why?

984
02:02:44,055 --> 02:02:45,056
Uncle...

985
02:02:46,468 --> 02:02:48,269
The temple is gone.

986
02:02:50,671 --> 02:02:54,385
It's okay. Shaolin Temple is in our hearts.

987
02:02:54,395 --> 02:02:57,007
It will never be burnt down.

988
02:03:24,584 --> 02:03:26,294
Life follows fate.

989
02:03:28,006 --> 02:03:32,690
Fate follows life. From which we can live at ease.

990
02:03:34,372 --> 02:03:35,373
Here.

991
02:03:36,544 --> 02:03:39,698
Hereon, she will keep you company.

992
02:03:54,432 --> 02:03:55,692
You won't go?

993
02:03:59,996 --> 02:04:01,528
Cao Man is here.

994
02:04:04,060 --> 02:04:06,583
His mistakes are also mine.

995
02:04:07,113 --> 02:04:09,005
Only I can help him.

996
02:04:13,479 --> 02:04:15,551
You've really changed.

997
02:04:19,865 --> 02:04:20,866
I know...

998
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:27,832
We can't be together again.

999
02:04:31,146 --> 02:04:32,147
But...

1000
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:38,403
I am really happy for you.

1001
02:04:39,403 --> 02:04:49,403
